            <h3>Status</h3>
            <p>Status is building powerful decentralized apps on Ethereum that change the way we do things on the web. Our rapidly growing team is made up of self-motivated individuals who prosper in a fast-paced environment and value the ability to work from anywhere.</p>
            <p>As a product, Status is an open source discovery tool for the Ethereum blockchain that makes it easy for anyone to access apps and services built on the decentralized web. Status also allows users to browse, chat, make payments and more.</p>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Although still in its infancy, blockchain technology is developing rapidly and is poised to have a profound impact on our social, financial and legal systems. By joining us, you’ll help to craft the way people interact with these technologies.</p>
            <p>This is a non-trivial challenge as we should not only make an easy-to-use app and create a seamless user experience, but use the interface as a way to explain how a decentralised system will benefit people. We are a tight-knit team, where designers are welcome to take part in the identification of the problems, the prioritisation of which of those problems are most important to solve. </p>
